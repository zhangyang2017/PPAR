## Abstract
We previously reported that xanthohumol (XN), a natural hop compound, and its synthetic derivative tetrahydro-XN (TXN) attenuates high-fat diet (HFD) induced weight gain and metabolic syndrome in C57Bl/6J mice. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of supplementing the same HFD diet with a low XN-dose (LXN), high XN-dose (HXN), and a low dose of TXN on energy expenditure and lipid accumulation in adipose and liver tissue. Our results showed that non-supplemented male mice were unable to adapt their caloric intake to the calorie-dense HFD, resulting in obesity and hepatic steatosis. Supplementing a HFD with TXN increased physical activity levels, attenuated adipose accumulation, and protected against hepatic steatosis by inhibiting lipogenesis. Using a supervised machine-learning model, we identified 13 genes that indicated TXN might antagonize lipogenic PPARγ actions in vivo. XN and TXN inhibited rosiglitazone-induced adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells concomitant with decreased expression of lipogenesis-related genes. A TR-FRET PPARγ competitive binding assay revealed that XN and TXN bind to PPARγ with an IC50 similar to that of pioglitazone and 8-10 times stronger than oleate. Consistent with competitive binding results, molecular docking simulations demonstrated XN and TXN bind in the pocket of the PPARγ ligand-binding domain with relative binding affinities, ranked in decreasing value of their negative binding energies with TXN > XN > oleate. In conclusion, we identified XN and TXN as novel partial PPARγ antagonists that attenuate adipose accumulation, and protect against hepatic steatosis on a HFD by inhibiting lipogenesis.
